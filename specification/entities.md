### Card
A card has two sides, each side contains information like test or images.
Each card belongs to a deck.

Each card has a status: a quality that represents how well a person remembers the content. 
Depending on the status, the algorithm decides when to offer this card for a review. 
The better a user remembers a card, the further in future it is scheduled for a review.

- Deck ID to which a card belongs

- Back side with content which user needs to remember
- Status: a user says how well they remembered the content 
- Date and time of the last review
